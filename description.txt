Terramon, created by CrimsonTek.

What does it do?

Terramon adds Pokemon-esque types to Terraria! Every vanilla weapon and enemy is given a type, and types that are effective will deal more damage. I included the 18 types found in Pokemon, as well as Blood and Bone to round out the Crimson and Dungeon biomes respectively. 

This mod adds no items or enemies yet, only functionality. This means you can try it in a world you've already started, and it won't mess up your game!


Special Thanks to all the people that helped me with this mod.
